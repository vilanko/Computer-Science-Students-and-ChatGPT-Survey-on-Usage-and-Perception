The issue with it comes if students use it to copy and paste. ChatGPT is not even good when you try to copy and paste. The good of ChatGPT comes after you learn how to create good prompts and when you use it as a full time assistant, asking him when you have issues understanding a concept, an issue, or any other thing that requires outside information(e.g. internet, books, etc.)

The main ways I used ChatGPT in my academic years was: 
- explaining things from class I did not understand 
- summarise chapters of books I had to read in order to accumulate the information faster
- debug my code faster by sending the code and explaining the problem with it.
- generating creative ideas when I needed them(e.g. engaging titles for papers)","Strongly disagree","","","Always","Frequently","1 to 2 years","No"
